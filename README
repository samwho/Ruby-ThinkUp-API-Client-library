# Ruby ThinkUp API Client Library

This is my first ever project in Ruby so you'll have to go easy on me :)

The thinkup_api.rb file contains the client library. main.rb is a Sinatra application I use to test the client
library during development.

To use the client library you'll need the json gem.
